# React Calculator

See live github page here: https://gsmperera.github.io/calculator-react

This web app was buid using Reactjs as a [freecodecamp.org challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

There are two main schools of thought on calculator input logic:

1. Immediate Execution Logic
2. Formula/Expression Logic

This calculator utilizes formula logic and observes order of operation precedence, immediate execution does not.

Example: 3 + 5 x 6 - 2 / 4 =

-   Immediate Executio Logic: 11.5
-   Formula/Expression Logic: 32.5
